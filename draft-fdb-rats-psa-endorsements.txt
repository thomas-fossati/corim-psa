1.  Introduction

   PSA Endorsements include reference values, cryptographic key material
   and certification status information that a Verifier needs in order
   to appraise attestation Evidence produced by a PSA device
   [PSA-TOKEN].  This memo defines such PSA Endorsements as a profile of
   the CoRIM data model [CoRIM].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms defined in
   Section 2.1 of [PSA-TOKEN] and in Section 4 of [RATS-ARCH].

3.  PSA Endorsements

   PSA Endorsements describe an attesting device in terms of the
   hardware and firmware components that make up its PSA Root of Trust
   (RoT).  This includes the identification and expected state of the
   device as well as the cryptographic key material needed to verify
   Evidence signed by the device's PSA RoT.  Additionally, PSA
   Endorsements can include information related to the certification
   status of the attesting device.

   There are five types of PSA Endorsements:

   *  Reference Values (Section 3.3), i.e., measurements of the PSA RoT
      firmware;

   *  Attestation Verification Claims (Section 3.4), i.e., cryptographic
      keys that can be used to verify signed Evidence produced by the
      PSA RoT, along with the identifiers that bind the keys to their
      device instances;

   *  Certification Claims (Section 3.5), i.e., metadata that describe
      the certification status associated with a PSA device;

   *  Software Relations (Section 3.3.1), used to model upgrade and
      patch relationships between software components;

   *  Endorsements Block List (Section 3.6), used to invalidate
      previously provisioned Endorsements.

3.1.  PSA Endorsement Profile

   PSA Endorsements are carried in one or more CoMIDs inside a CoRIM.

   The profile attribute in the CoRIM MUST be present and MUST have a
   single entry set to the uri http://arm.com/psa/iot/1 as shown in
   Figure 1.

   / corim-map / {
     / corim.profile / 3: [
       32("http://arm.com/psa/iot/1")
     ]
     / ... /
   }

3.2.  PSA Endorsements to PSA RoT Linkage

   Each PSA Endorsement - be it a Reference Value, Attestation
   Verification Claim or Certification Claim - is associated with an
   immutable PSA RoT.  A PSA Endorsement is associated to its PSA RoT by
   means of the unique PSA RoT identifier known as Implementation ID
   (see Section 3.2.2 of [PSA-TOKEN]).

   In order to support PSA Implementation IDs, the CoMID type $class-id-
   type-choice is extended as follows:

   ; from draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token
   psa-implementation-id-type = bytes .size 32

   tagged-implementation-id-type = #6.600(implementation-id-type)

   $class-id-type-choice /= tagged-implementation-id-type

   Besides, a PSA Endorsement can be associated with a specific instance
   of a certain PSA RoT - as in the case of Attestation Verification
   Claims.  A PSA Endorsement is associated with a PSA RoT instance by
   means of the Instance ID (see Section 3.2.1 of [PSA-TOKEN]) and its
   "parent" Implementation ID.

   These identifiers are typically found in the subject of a CoMID
   triple, encoded in an environment-map as shown in Figure 2.

   / environment-map / {
     / comid.class / 0 : {
       / comid.class-id / 0 :
         / tagged-impl-id-type / 600(
           h'61636d652d696d706c656d656e746174
             696f6e2d69642d303030303030303031'
         ),
         / comid.vendor / 1 : "ACME Ltd.",
         / comid.model /  2 : "Roadrunner 1.0"
     },
     / comid.instance / 1 :
       / tagged-ueid-type / 550(
         h'01
           4ca3e4f50bf248c39787020d68ffd05c
           88767751bf2645ca923f57a98becd296'
       )
   }

                  Figure 2: Example PSA RoT Identification

   Optional vendor and model can be specified as well.  Together, they
   are interpreted as a unique identifier of the product that embeds the
   PSA RoT.  It is RECOMMENDED to consistently provide a product
   identifier.

3.3.  Reference Values

   Reference Values carry measurements and other metadata associated
   with the updatable firmware in a PSA RoT.  When appraising Evidence,
   the Verifier compares Reference Values against the values found in
   the Software Components of the PSA token (see Section 3.4.1 of
   [PSA-TOKEN]).

   Each measurement is encoded in a measurement-map of a CoMID
   reference-triple-record.  Since a measurement-map can encode one or
   more measurements, a single reference-triple-record can carry as many
   measurements as needed, provided they belong to the same PSA RoT
   identified in the subject of the "reference value" triple.  A single
   reference-triple-record MUST completely describe the updatable PSA
   RoT.

   The identifier of a measured software component is encoded in a psa-
   swcomp-id object as follows:

   psa-swcomp-id = {
     &(signer-id: 0) => psa.hash-type
     &(measurement-id: 1) => psa.hash-type
   }

   psa.hash-type = bytes .size 32 / bytes .size 48 / bytes .size 64

   The semantics of the codepoints in the psa-swcomp-id map are
   equivalent to those in the psa-software-component map defined in
   Section 3.4.1 of [PSA-TOKEN].  The psa-swcomp-id MUST uniquely
   identify a given software component within the PSA RoT / product.

   In order to support PSA Reference Value identifiers, the CoMID type
   $measured-element-type-choice is extended as follows:

   tagged-psa-swcomp-id = #6.601(psa-swcomp-id)

   $measured-element-type-choice /= tagged-psa-swcomp-id

   and automatically bound to the comid.mkey in the measurement-map.

   The raw measurement is encoded in a digests-type object in the
   measurement-values-map.  The digests-type array MUST contain at least
   one entry.  The digests-type array MAY contain more than one entry if
   multiple digests (obtained with different hash algorithms) of the
   same measured component exist.

   The example in Figure 3 shows a CoMID encoding a PSA Endorsement of
   type Reference Value for a firmware measurement associated with
   Implementation ID acme-implementation-id-000000001.

3.3.1.  Software Upgrades and Patches

   In order to model software lifecycle events such as updates and
   patches, this profile defines a new triple that conveys the following
   semantics:

   *  SUBJECT: a software component

   *  PREDICATE: (non-critically / critically) (updates / patches)

   *  OBJECT: another software component

   The triple is reified and used as the object of another triple, psa-
   swrel-triple-record, whose subject is the embedding environment.

   comid.psa-swrel-triples = 5

   $$triples-map-extension //= (
     comid.psa-swrel-triples => [ + psa-swrel-triple-record ]
   )

   psa.updates = 1
   psa.patches = 2

   psa-swrel-rel = [
     type: psa.updates / psa.patches
     security-critical: bool ; true means it's a fix for a security bug
   ]

   sw-rel = [
     new: psa-swcomp-id ; identifier of the "new" firmware
     rel: psa-swrel-rel ; patches, updates and the security flag
     old: psa-swcomp-id ; identifier of the "old" firmware
   ]

   psa-swrel-triple-record = [
     environment-map
     sw-rel
   ]

   An example of a security critical update involving versions "1.3.5"
   and "1.4.0" of software component "PRoT" within the target
   environment associated with Implementation ID acme-implementation-
   id-000000001 is shown in Figure 4.

3.4.  Attestation Verification Claims

   An Attestation Verification Claim carries the verification key
   associated with the Initial Attestation Key (IAK) of a PSA device.
   When appraising Evidence, the Verifier uses the Implementation ID and
   Instance ID claims (see Section 3.2) to retrieve the verification key
   that it SHALL use to check the signature on the Evidence.  This
   allows the Verifier to prove (or disprove) the Attester's claimed
   identity.

   Each verification key is provided alongside the corresponding device
   Instance and Implementation IDs (and, possibly, a product identifier)
   in an attest-key-triple-record.  Specifically:

   *  The Instance and Implementation IDs are encoded in the
      environment-map as shown in Figure 2;

   *  The IAK public key is carried in the comid.key entry in the
      verification-key-map.  The IAK public key is a PEM-encoded
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280].  There MUST be only one
      verification-key-map in an attest-key-triple-record;

   *  The optional comid.keychain entry MUST NOT be set by a CoMID
      producer that uses the profile described in this document, and
      MUST be ignored by a CoMID consumer that is parsing according to
      this profile.

   The example in Figure 5 shows the PSA Endorsement of type Attestation
   Verification Claim carrying a secp256r1 EC public IAK associated with
   Instance ID 4ca3...d296.

              Figure 5: Example Attestation Verification Claim

3.5.  Certification Claims

   PSA Certified [PSA-CERTIFIED] defines a certification scheme for the
   PSA ecosystem.  A product - either a hardware component, a software
   component, or an entire device - that is verified to meet the
   security criteria established by the PSA Certified scheme is
   warranted a PSA Certified Security Assurance Certificate (SAC).  A
   SAC contains information about the certification of a certain product
   (e.g., the target system, the attained certification level, the test
   lab that conducted the evaluation, etc.), and has a unique
   Certificate Number.

   The linkage between a PSA RoT -- comprising the immutable part as
   well as zero or more of the mutable components -- and the associated
   SAC is provided by a Certification Claim, which binds the PSA RoT
   Implementation ID and the software component identifiers with the SAC
   unique Certificate Number.  When appraising Evidence, the Verifier
   can use the Certification Claims associated with the identified
   Attester as ancillary input to the Appraisal Policy, or to enrich the
   produced Attestation Result.

   A Certification Claim is encoded in an psa-cert-triple-record, which
   extends the $$triples-map-extension socket, as follows:

   comid.psa-cert-triples = 4

   $$triples-map-extension //= (
     comid.psa-cert-triples => [ + psa-cert-triple-record ]
   )

   psa-rot-descriptor = {
     &(immutable-prot: 1) => psa-implementation-id-type
     &(mutable-prot: 2) => [ * psa-swcomp-id ]

   }

   psa-cert-triple-record = [
     psa-rot-descriptor
     psa-cert-num-type
   ]

   psa-cert-num-type = text .regexp "[0-9]{13} - [0-9]{5}"

   *  The Implementation ID of the immutable PSA RoT to which the SAC
      applies is encoded as a tagged-impl-id-type in the psa.immutable-
      rot of the psa-rot-descriptor;

   *  Any software component that is part of the certified PSA RoT is
      encoded as a psa-swcomp-id (see Section 3.3) in the psa.mutable-
      rot of the psa-rot-descriptor;

   *  The unique SAC Certificate Number is encoded in the psa-cert-num-
      type.

   A single CoMID can carry one or more Certification Claims.

   The example in Figure 6 shows a Certification Claim that associates
   Certificate Number 1234567890123 - 12345 to Implementation ID acme-
   implementation-id-000000001 and a single "PRoT" software component
   with version "1.3.5".

3.6.  Endorsements Block List


   // This is work in progress.  It may change or be removed in the
   // future.

   The following three "blocklist" claims:

   *  reference-blocklist-triple

   *  attest-key-blocklist-triple

   *  cert-blocklist-triple

   are defined with the same syntax but opposite semantics with regards
   to their "positive" counterparts to allow invalidating previously
   provisioned endorsements from the acceptable set.

4.  Security Considerations


   // TODO

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  CBOR Tag Registrations

   IANA is requested to allocate the following tag in the "CBOR Tags"
   registry [IANA.cbor-tags], preferably with the specified value:

            +=======+=========================+===============+
            | 4     | comid.psa-cert-triples  | RFCTHIS       |
            +-------+-------------------------+---------------+
            | 5     | comid.psa-swrel-triples | RFCTHIS       |
            +-------+-------------------------+---------------+
